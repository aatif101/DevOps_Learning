# My DevOps Learning Journey

I'm working through a 10-step DevOps course and using this repo to track my progress and take notes. Nothing fancy, just a place to dump what I learn so I can reference it later.

## Where I'm At

- [done] **Step 1:** Linux Basics & Server Management
- [ ] **Step 2:** Bash Scripting & Automation  
- [ ] **Step 3:** AWS Fundamentals & Cloud Computing
- [ ] **Step 4:** CI/CD with Jenkins & Git
- [ ] **Step 5:** Python Scripting for DevOps
- [ ] **Step 6:** Ansible Configuration Management
- [ ] **Step 7:** Advanced AWS & Infrastructure
- [ ] **Step 8:** Docker & Kubernetes
- [ ] **Step 9:** Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- [ ] **Step 10:** GitOps & Advanced Deployment

## How I Use This

1. **Go to each step folder** when I start a new section
2. **Jot down notes** in the "Quick Notes" section while watching videos
3. **Copy important commands** into the "Commands Used" section
4. **Write a quick summary** when I finish each topic
5. **Check off steps** above as I complete them
6. **Come back here** when I need to remember something

Just keeping it simple so I can focus on learning instead of organizing.
